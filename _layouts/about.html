              <h3>1 Define a receptor</h3>
              <p>
                A receptor is defined as a location at a specific time that we are interested in. Often receptors are the location/time that a measurement is made, allowing us to investigate what happened to the air before it arrived at the measurement location.

              <h3>2 Release and follow particles</h3>
              <p>
                A cloud of theoretical particles are released from the receptor and followed as they travel backward in time. The average trajectory of the particle cloud is calculated using meteorological wind fields and random velocities are introduced for each particle using a Markov chain process to approximate turbulent motions.

              <h3>3 Calculate influence footprint</h3>
              <p>
                The surface influence footprint is calculated using the positions and height above ground of the particles at each time step. Footprints define the area upstream from the receptor as well as the strength of the influence from any given location within the model domain. These footprints can be easily convolved with surface flux inventories to model the contribution of near-field surface fluxes on the receptor.

              <h3>4 Evaluate emissions</h3>
              <p>
                Using STILT to relate measurements to emissions estimates is a powerful method for mapping pollution, fine-tuning emissions inventories, and tracking changes in emissions over time. Get creative - this is where the science happens.
