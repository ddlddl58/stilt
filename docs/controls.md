# Controls

The following parameters are found in `r/run_stilt.r` and are used to configure STILT. These settings are used to adjust model parameters, execute parallelized simulations, and calculate produce upstream influence footprints.

### System configuration

Arg       | Description
----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------
`project` | Project name
`stilt_wd`| Working directory for the given project
`lib.loc` | Path to R package installations, passed to `library()`

### Parallel simulation settings

Arg       | Description
----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------
`n_nodes` | If using SLURM for job submission, number of nodes to utilize
`n_cores` | Number of cores per node to parallelize simulations by receptor locations and times
`slurm`   | Logical indicating the use of rSLURM to submit job(s). When using SLURM, a `_rslurm` directory is created at the top level of the STILT project. This directory contains the SLURM submission scripts and node-specific log files.
`slurm_options` | Named list of options passed to `sbatch` using `rslurm::slurm_apply()`, which typically includes `time`, `account`, and `partition` values

### Simulation timing

Arg               | Description
------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------
`t_start/t_end`   | Simulation timing, formatted as `'yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS'` UTC
`run_times`       | Hourly simulations spanning `t_start` through `t_end` of length *n*

### Receptor locations

Arg               | Description
------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------
`lati`            | Receptor latitude(s), in degrees. Can be a single value or a vector of length *n*
`long`            | Receptor longitude(s), in degrees. Can be a single value or a vector of length *n*
`zagl`            | Receptor height(s), in meters above ground level. Can be a single value or a vector of length *n*

> Simulation timing and receptor locations are defined in this way for convenience and then expanded to contain the unique receptors in a *x*, *y*, *z*, *t* table. For more complex lists of receptors, this table can be created manually instead of using the simulation timing and receptor location definitions. To specify the receptors manually, a data frame named `receptors` can be created with column names `run_time` (POSIXct), `long` (double), `lati` (double), and `zagl` (double).

### Meteorological data input

Arg               | Description
------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------
`met_directory`   | Full directory path in which ARL compatible meteorological data files can be found
`met_file_format` | `strftime()` compatible file naming convention to identify meteorological data files necessary for the timing of the simulation, such as `%Y%m%d` or `%Y%m%d.%H`
`n_met_min`       | Minimum number of meteorological data files with which to proceed with simulation. Useful for capturing missing periods. For a -24 hour simulation using the 6 hour HRRR met data files, `n_met_min` should be set to 5, since `find_met_files()` ensures that data before and after the simulation is included.

> NOAA publishes High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) mesoscale model data in the ARL packed format required for STILT at [ftp://arlftp.arlhq.noaa.gov/pub/archives/hrrr/](ftp://arlftp.arlhq.noaa.gov/pub/archives/hrrr/). This is often the easiest place to start but is only available after June 15, 2015. The coupling of the popular Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with STILT is well documented by [Nehrkorn, 2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00703-010-0068-x).
