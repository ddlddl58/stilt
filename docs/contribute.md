# Contribute to the STILT project

STILT would not be possible without the strong community of developers behind it. This distribution contains a completely redesigned STILT wrapper and proposes a centralized, collaborative platform for documentation and future development. Model development in the form of feature enhancements, documentation updates, bug fixes, or simple suggestions from the community are welcome.

- If you want to file a bug report or suggest something new,
  - Ensure there are no related reports by [searching open issues](https://github.com/uataq/stilt/issues)
  - After verifying there are no related open issues, [open a new issue](https://github.com/uataq/stilt/issues/new)
- Think you can fix it yourself? [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [STILT repository](https://github.com/uataq/stilt), implement your changes, and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/uataq/stilt/pulls) to merge your changes into the master repository

# Special Repository Branches

Source code for the STILT model, website, and documentation are all included in the [STILT repository](https://github.com/uataq/stilt).
